# Agent Skills

This directory contains [Agent Skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills) — specialized, reusable instructions that guide AI agents to perform specific tasks according to project best practices.

## Cross-Tool Compatibility

Skills are stored here (`.github/skills/`) as the canonical source and symlinked to `.opencode/skills/` for OpenCode CLI compatibility. Both tools read the same `SKILL.md` files.

| Tool | Discovery Path |
|------|---------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code, CLI, Coding Agent) | `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **OpenCode CLI** | `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (symlinks) |
| **Other agents** (Cursor, Codex, etc.) | Root `AGENTS.md` lists all skills |

### Adding a new skill

1. Create `.github/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Add symlink: `cd .opencode/skills && ln -s ../../.github/skills/your-skill-name your-skill-name`

## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are folders containing structured instructions, workflows, and examples that Copilot agents can use to handle specialized tasks. Each skill has:

- **SKILL.md**: Main skill file with YAML frontmatter and detailed instructions
- **Frontmatter**: Metadata including name, description, and when to use the skill
- **Body**: Detailed workflows, commands, examples, and troubleshooting guidance

Skills are automatically discovered by Copilot in VS Code, GitHub CLI, and Copilot agents.

## How to Use Skills

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code / CLI)
Skills are automatically discovered from `.github/skills/`. Reference them in chat:
```
@workspace Use the android-debug skill to help me fix this crash
```

### OpenCode CLI
Skills are discovered from `.opencode/skills/` (symlinked to `.github/skills/`):
```
Use the build-fix skill to diagnose my Gradle error
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
.github/skills/
└── skill-name/
    └── SKILL.md          # Main skill file
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Title

Detailed instructions, workflows, examples, and resources.
```

## Creating New Skills

To add a new skill:

1. **Create directory**: `.github/skills/your-skill-name/`
2. **Create SKILL.md** with:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description)
   - Clear "When to Use" section
   - Structured workflow or instructions
   - Examples and code snippets
   - Troubleshooting guidance
   - Links to relevant resources

3. **Add OpenCode symlink**:
   ```bash
   cd .opencode/skills && ln -s ../../.github/skills/your-skill-name your-skill-name
   ```

4. **Follow best practices**:
   - Use lowercase-with-hyphens for skill names
   - Be specific about when to use the skill
   - Include practical examples
   - Add commands and code snippets
   - Provide troubleshooting steps
   - Keep instructions actionable

5. **Update this README**: Add your skill to the list above

## Skill Guidelines

**Good skills**:
- Focus on specific, repeatable tasks
- Include clear workflows and decision trees
- Provide concrete examples and commands
- Document edge cases and gotchas
- Reference project-specific configuration

**Avoid**:
- Vague or overly broad guidance
- Duplicating information available in docs
- Skills that are too similar to existing ones
- Complex dependencies between skills
